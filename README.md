# RailMail

> Etymology: (*Reactive Mail* -> Rail) + Mail, just for the rhymes.

RailMail is a Reactive Mail dispatcher written in F#.
It takes Mail requests from AMQP/RabbitMQ and a REST API.
Dispatch happens over SMTP.

## API

Envelope information is transmitted in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "recipients": "test@test.com",
  "subject": "Funky Mail Dispatcher!",
  "body": {
    "text": "Hey Flo, I found that great service called RailMail! Check it out!",
    "html": "Hey <b>Flo</b>, ... "
  }
}
```
This JSON is sent either to the specified AMQP Queue or POSTed to the REST Endpoint "/mail".

```sh
curl \
  -X POST \
  --data '{ "recipient": ... }' \
  http://railmail:5000/mail
```
